# SpaceVIP : A VR Experience On The Moon
> Fullstack Academy Stackathon Project

# The Challenge
To select a "stack" to learn and use to build a project in 5 days.

# Framework
I selected A-Frame, a WebVR Framework for designing Virtual Reality experiences, using primarily HTML and Javascript.

# Motivation
As a Virtual Reality enthusiast, I was inspired to build an experience similar to a Second Life Virtual Reality scene that I would frequently visit while playing the game.

# How To Use
Desktop: To navigate the scene, use the hand icon to grab and drag the direction of interest. To interact with elements, hover over and align elements with the red disc and click.

Mobile: To navigate the scene, use finger to move screen to the direction of interest. To interact with elements, hover over and align elements with the red disc and click.

Headset: Click the headset icon on the bottom right. To navigate the scene, move head in the direction of interest. To interact with elements, hover over and align elements with the red disc and wait.
